# CS512-Computer-Vision-Project
This is a computer vision project, I implemeted a algorithm for image inpainting using Python.

The algorithm is called Fast Marching Method whihch will inpaint the damaged image using a given cover.

The source code folder contains the Python source code.

The Presentation has two versions pdf and ppt. 

The report gives the detailed description of the algorithm.
